                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">The Solar System has 5 dwarf planets. Although they are designated with planet labels, it is important to know they aren't planets. Pluto was once considered a planet but was declassified in 2003. To be considered a planet, you need to have a spherical shape and be a certain size. The bigger the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull. Dwarf planets are not big enough to pull in nearby objects.</p>
